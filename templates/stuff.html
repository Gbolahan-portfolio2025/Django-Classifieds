Logging or monitoring (for production later)

👤 User Account Management
Profile page or dashboard (maybe with gravatar or bio?)

“My Ads” page (✓ done)

Ability to delete own account (Django doesn’t add this by default)

Password reset, email confirm (Allauth handles this if SMTP is set)

💾 Media Handling
File/image upload working?

Thumbnails or image resizing?

Do broken/missing images render gracefully?

🧠 Admin Experience
Is Django admin customized at all? E.g. searchable fields, list display?

Can staff moderate ads?

Are permissions/staff roles clear?
